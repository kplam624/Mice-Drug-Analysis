# matplotlib-challenge
This contains a script to analyze pharmaceutical data about mice and tumor volumes. The goal is analyze the mice as well as the drug regimens used in the study. The main drug analysis is done on Capumulin.

## Resources
Within the resources file, contains the csv needed to perform the analysis.
### Software used:
* Python: 3.7.4
* matplotlib: 3.2.2
* pandas: 1.0.5
* scipy: 1.5.0
* numpy: 1.17.0
* Jupyter notebooks to display our code
## Test
File used to hold pseudocode and any extra work.

## Submission
Within the submission file contains the script that will run the analysis. Along with the code will contain images of the charts individually.

Within the script will contain extra insight that would assist in explaining certain irregularities within the charts.

Analysis that has been done include:
* Statistics Table(mean, median, variance(var), standard deviation(std), sem)
* Bar plot of the total number of data points for each drug regimen
* Pie Chart that compares the parity of the mices' sex.
* The median of selected drug regimens and quantitatively determines what values are outliers
* A box and whiskers plot to graphically show outliers
* A line plot for one mouse being given Capumulin



Below are the charts that have been created using both matplotlib packages and pandas.plot.
